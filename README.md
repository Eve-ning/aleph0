# Python Scripts for Aleph-0

Note: Some parts are manually edited in the final output, so it may not be exact.

## Description

These are the python scripts used in generated Aleph-0. It pivots off of my `reamberPy` library . w.)b

These are all for reference on how you can use `svMeasureLineMD` algorithm in my library or if you're interested on how some are generated.

These files are labelled by the **%** in the map. e.g. ``f123`` is used in **12.3%** of the map.

## Usage

Feel free to use the scripts for your map, note that it's not optimized to just be copy pasted.

## Files

- `f___.py` files are SV/BPM/Note generating files.
- `sb.py` is the storyboard generating file.
- `main.py` is the overhead to calling all `f___.py` files

## Visualizing Functions (Desmos)

I frequently used Desmos to visualize how all of these measure lines are generated. I heavily recommend trying it out too!

# Disclaimer

Most coding format/practises here are not optimized, especially variable naming. If you're beginning to code, it's not recommended to follow these styles.
